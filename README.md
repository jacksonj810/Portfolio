# Data Analysis Portfolio

# Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio!

I am a data enthusiast with experience in using various tools to collect, clean, and analyze data to inform business decisions. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. In addition, I have a strong understanding of data analysis techniques, including dashboard building, report writing, data collecting, data merging, statistics, and critical thinking.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analysis skills. Below you will find links to dashboards and reports I have created using tools like Tableau, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear, visually appealing way, making it easy for decision-makers to understand insights and take actionable steps.

I have also included my work with programming languages such as Python and SQL. These projects highlight my ability to work with large datasets, perform data collection, and extract important insights from complex data. I‚Äôve successfully combined data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view that supports strategic decision-making. Additionaly to my technical skills, I also bring hands-on experience gained through numerous lab classes during my college education. These labs provided me with opportunities to practice problem-solving, critical thinking, and data analysis in real-world scenarios, furthering my ability to approach data with a careful and analytical mindset.

I am confident that my data analysis skills and project experience make me a strong candidate for roles in data analysis. I hope you find my portfolio insightful and engaging, and I look forward to discussing my qualifications and experiences with you.

## üìä Featured Projects

### 1. **[E-commerce Sales Performance](https://github.com/jacksonj810/E-commerce-Sales-Analysis/tree/main)**
- **Objective:** Analyze e-commerce sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and channel profitability to optimize revenue and inventory strategies.
- **Skills:**  Python, Pandas, Tableau, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization
- **Key Insights:** 
  - Identified top-performing categories and channels driving the majority of revenue.
  - Highlighted peak sales periods, uncovering seasonal trends and opportunities for targeted campaigns.
  - Detected underperforming categories and declining sales trends to inform inventory and marketing adjustments.
- **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau

### 2. **[Sphere Integrated Circuit Analysis](https://github.com/jacksonj810/E-commerce-Sales-Analysis/tree/main)**
- **Objective:** Investigate relationships between IC cost, power dissipation, node size, and packaging to inform sourcing decisions and identify cost drivers.
- **Skills:**  Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seasborn, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization
- **Key Insights:** 
  - Found that lead count showed a strong positive correlation with cost, indicating higher-pin packages tend to be pricier.
  - Observed only a weak link between max power dissipation and cost, suggesting other factors (e.g., complexity, family type) drive pricing more.
  - Identified a mild negative correlation between smaller node sizes and higher costs, in allignment with advanced manufacturing processes.
  - Compared multiple distributor price columns, revealing variability in cost and availability across suppliers.
- **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Excel
